<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be provided to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in hard water can trigger a bad odor and taste. When you add a water softener, it eliminates the mineral material to produce odor-free drinking water that tastes good.</p>
<p>When you've discovered the trip lever you want, all you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct method. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are ready to hook up your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the trip lever.</p>

If your existing kitchen components are triggering leakages and including excess moisture under the sink and on counter tops, then call for repairs or replacement and set your mind at ease.</p>
