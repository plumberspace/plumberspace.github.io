<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
