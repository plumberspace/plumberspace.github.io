<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your tub, sink or shower. Gradually, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them hard to eliminate.

<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common.

Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and spying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
