<p>Pools of septic waste. One of the more apparent outdoor signs is if you can see sewage pooling in your backyard. The problem might be a broken main sewer line if your yard smells nasty and there's a puddle that just won't go away. The waste disposal unit is leaking: This is caused by a damaged hose or seal. We'll thoroughly examine your system to discover the issue and perform the necessary repair.</p>

Gene Johnson Plumbing & Heating has technicians thoroughly trained to discover the place of the leak, and either repair or replace the pipe, depending on the seriousness of the leak. Before employing any professional, make certain to ask for complimentary estimates on just how much it will cost to fix your plumbing problems. While you definitely wish to get your kitchen faucet up and running once again (you've got dishes to do! Household to feed!), you do not want to overpay or be captured with an unexpected expenditure.</p>
