<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
