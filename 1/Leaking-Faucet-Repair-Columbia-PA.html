<h3>Leaky Faucets in Columbia PA 17512 - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>

With time, the material your drain is made of can start to wear away, degrade, and ultimately crack with regular use, leading to a leak.

<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are primarily time associated. If whatever is ready, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the overall expenses. Many plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>
