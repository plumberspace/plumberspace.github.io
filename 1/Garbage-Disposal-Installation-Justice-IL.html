Recurring repairs and leaks.

To discover an ideal replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, however opportunities are you'll find among the very same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
