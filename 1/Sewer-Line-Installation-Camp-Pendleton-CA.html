Unpleasant stenches are a direct outcome of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up builds up, it can cause more powerful smells, and more severe piping problems. Without practical draining pipes, excessive pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak leading to pricey water damage.</p>

<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Camp Pendleton CA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
