This device includes no less than 5 individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves).

The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
