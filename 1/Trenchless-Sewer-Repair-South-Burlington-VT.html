When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
