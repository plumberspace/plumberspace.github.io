<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based on polymer type ingredients such as sodium polycarboxylate.
