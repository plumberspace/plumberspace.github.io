Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline.

<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
