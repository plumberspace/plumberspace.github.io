The pre-programmed number represents the amount of time between each regeneration. For example, a lower chosen number implies your softener will regenerate less often. Try choosing a lower number until you find one that meets your needs if you are experiencing spots. Demand-initiated softeners are more efficient and popular than time-initiated softeners.</p>
