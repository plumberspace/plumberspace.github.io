<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Jewett City CT</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Another threat that can arise from the bad or incorrect installation of a gas line or appliance is an increase carbon monoxide gas levels in your home. It is tough to discover carbon monoxide because it is odor-free and unappetizing although it is extremely harmful.
