<p>The more frequently a waste disposal unit is utilized (properly), the better it will grind food waste and resist rusting. You can keep odors away by grinding up lemon or orange peels inside it. More difficult products, like eggshells and fish bones, scour the disposal walls and assist keep them clean as well.

<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
<p>The concern of leakage can be attributed to any number of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, in addition to bad maintenance. The hot water heater tank should have some room to represent the expansion that occurs when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to leave, hence the need for a growth tank to help manage the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force put in by the growth taking place when boiling the water causes the tank to crack and start leaking. The solution for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
