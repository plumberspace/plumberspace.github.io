<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens.

An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
