<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
