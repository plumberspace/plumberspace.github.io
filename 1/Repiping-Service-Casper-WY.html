<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than removing the clog with negative pressure, it in fact pushes into the blockage, working further into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps require it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
