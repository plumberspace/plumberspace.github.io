<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and meet our rigid trust accreditation requirements. A great guideline is to replace faucets that show corrosion, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and rusted parts make repairs tough and expensive, implying a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the right fix for concerns such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the entire component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Retail prices for home water softeners might vary from approximately $400 to $2,700, depending on the size and kind of softener.

Excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
