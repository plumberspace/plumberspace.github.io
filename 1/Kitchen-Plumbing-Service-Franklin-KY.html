<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions.

The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
