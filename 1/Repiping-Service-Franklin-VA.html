<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Franklin VA 23851</h3>
<p>A sewer leak on your drain line, or main sewer line, can be tough to spot and can likewise damage your residential or commercial property. Standing or ponding water from leaking sewer lines are also a health danger and regularly go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also weaken your drain system and cause separations. Because the source of leaking water can be hard to detect, our plumbers often perform a dye test to determine the source. Frequently, pipes or water service lines are replaced, only to discover they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not constantly dirty or discolored and often gets mistaken for a water system line leak.</p>
<p>Installing a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will generally range from $300 to $800 depending upon the length of the pipe required. If you're converting your home to gas, or if the current line is at capacity, expect to spend $2,000 or more. Brand-new gas line costs consist of appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, known as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them functioning appropriately. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality. If a repipe in Brenham is ideal for you, call today at (979) 200-6674 to have your plumbing checked and we will let you know.</p>
