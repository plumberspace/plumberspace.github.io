<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best utilized in vital locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten up the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
