<p>It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a correctly operating RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas based on water damage. Adequate drainage should also be provided.</p>
