<p>The Required Inspections Table shown below lists those inspections that must be carried out to validate that your work abides by the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Regulations. Please note that Virginia's Building Code prohibits making use of any plumbing components or devices prior to approval of all needed inspections. We hope this list is beneficial to you throughout the course of your job. Please call our Structure Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any concerns about what is needed for each inspection or if you need assistance scheduling an inspection. Building, Electrical, Mechanical or Fire Protection work require extra permits and inspections. Separate notifications are offered to discuss the inspections needed for each kind of authorization.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
