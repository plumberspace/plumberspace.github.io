Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, rusting the sidewalls and only partially fixing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively seek out natural material and gnaw at it, developing harmless by-products of carbon mineral, water, and dioxide ash, all of which are quickly treated at local sewage plants.</p>
