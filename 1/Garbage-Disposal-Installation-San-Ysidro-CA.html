<h3>Showerhead Replacement in San Ysidro California</h2>
<p>You may have heard stories about a warm water heater taking off inside a home or company! It is essential to understand that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your water heater can turn your hot water heater into a hazardous time bomb. The age of your water heater. A traditional tank water heater usually lasts anywhere from 8-12 years prior to needing a replacement, while a tankless water heater can last approximately 20 with correct maintenance and care.
