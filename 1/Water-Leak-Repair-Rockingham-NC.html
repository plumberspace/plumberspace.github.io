<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to get rid of chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and ends up in our lakes and streams. In houses with private wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic system and then ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>It doesn't always mean they need to be replaced if your pipes are older than these standards. Well-maintained pipes might last longer, and badly preserved ones or those in areas with tough water (meaning it has high mineral material), may fail sooner, says Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who supplied the lifespan estimates.</p>
