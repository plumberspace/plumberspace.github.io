WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
