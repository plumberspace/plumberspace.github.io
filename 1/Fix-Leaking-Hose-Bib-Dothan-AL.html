You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Inspect the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make sure it works. Examine below to be sure there aren't any leakages.
