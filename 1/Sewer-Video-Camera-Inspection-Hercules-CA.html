Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right way. When you've protected the trip lever and are all set to attach your flapper, ensure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
