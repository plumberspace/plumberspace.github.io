The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer assists require it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
