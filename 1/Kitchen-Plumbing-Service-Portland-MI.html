In severe cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically limit the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, however steel eventually suffers from corrosion and lacks the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
