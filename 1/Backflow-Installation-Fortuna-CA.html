<p>Every toilet obstructions from time to time. How often a toilet blockages depends on the strength of its flush, the tidiness of its drain pipes, and what it's trying to flush. If your toilet obstructs more than when a month-or even once a week!- it's most likely because mineral deposits have developed around the top of the drain or in the drain pipes themselves.</p>
