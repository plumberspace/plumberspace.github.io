<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
