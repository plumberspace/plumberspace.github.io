The water in your shower, sink, or toilet drains slowly - This is the most typical indication that you have actually got a drain stoppage. While sluggish draining pipes means the drain isn't entirely clogged, there's still sufficient buildup inside it to stop water and waste from going down simple.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
