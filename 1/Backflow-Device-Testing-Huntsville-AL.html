<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Huntsville AL</h3>

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
