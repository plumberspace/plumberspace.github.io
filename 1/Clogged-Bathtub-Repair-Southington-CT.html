<p>If you're coping with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless device repair bills, you need a water softener. Difficult water is not an issue that will disappear on its own and the costs sustained by difficult water will only continue to escalate. With a water softener, home appliances will undoubtedly fail earlier than their expected life expectancy. If scale continues to build up in your pipes, your flow rate will continue to restrict and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout your house.

<p>It is essential to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an effectively working RPZ assembly to regularly discharge percentages of water.

Adequate drainage should also be provided.</p>
