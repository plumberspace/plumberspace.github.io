Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to discover.</p>
<p>Property owners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage problems. Once a. month, use a plunger in your shower and tub drains to remove any stuck-on particles. Put hot water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice and salt in the waste disposal unit to eliminate grease.
