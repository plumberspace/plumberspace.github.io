<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Petal MS</h3>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is known as fouling. Sometimes it may be required to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin becomes fouled. Cleaners need to be used according to manufacturer instructions to prevent contamination.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden hose pipes: The extremely poisonous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company staff member had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other connected to an external house hose bibb (outside spigot). When the supply of water system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through the house into the water system.</p>
