<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits build up, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
