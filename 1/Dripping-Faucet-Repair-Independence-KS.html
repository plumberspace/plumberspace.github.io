<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
