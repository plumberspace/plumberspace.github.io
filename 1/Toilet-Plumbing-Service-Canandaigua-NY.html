<p>Great deals of bad things are being said on this short article about liners. I find that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no clue on what they are stating.

The installation should be evaluated to guarantee it does not circumvent the functions of the assembly. Test data need to be built up to figure out the functions of each element. The backflow prevention assembly need to be taken apart and parts replaced with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be tested once again to be sure it was properly fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the producers flowchart is essential to ensure it was repaired appropriately. A correctly fixed assembly needs to provide years of protection.</p>
