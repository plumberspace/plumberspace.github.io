They then find the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls. They will only get rid of as much structure material as necessary to reach, detach, and get rid of the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To gain access to pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling listed below it. If you want, you can arrange to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel.</p>
