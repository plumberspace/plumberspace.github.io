<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Ilion NY</h3>

A water filtration system with chiller will provide you with cool, clean, yummy water for every glass. At Bonney Plumbing, we comprehend the satisfaction of a gratifying drink of water. So, we concentrate on installation, repair and service of water purification systems and chillers for any application.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>

<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the system, now is the best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; recover the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
