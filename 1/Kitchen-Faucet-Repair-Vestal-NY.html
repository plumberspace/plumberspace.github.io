<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular circulation direction within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>A normal gas line can cost up to $1,000. The labor costs increase if the gas line is under a pathway, sprinkler system or trees.
