<p>If you're living with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless home appliance repair costs, you need a water softener. Hard water is not a problem that will go away by itself and the expenses sustained by hard water will just continue to escalate. With a water softener, appliances will inevitably stop working faster than their expected life expectancy. Your circulation rate will continue to limit and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout the home if scale continues to accumulate in your pipes. Hard water ravages water heaters, and without a softener, your utility bills will continue to barrel skyward. The continuous cycle of repairs and replacements will continue up until your house is protected by a water softener if your water supply is hard.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
