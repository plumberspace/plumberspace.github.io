<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is simply catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (normally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continuously bringing tanks online and off-line in response to the water needs of your carwash.

However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up.
