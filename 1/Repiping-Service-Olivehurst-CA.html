Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is really low.

<h3>Leaky Faucets in Olivehurst CA 95961 - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some homes were permitted to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of several toilets in the house. Usually, the supply of water to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
