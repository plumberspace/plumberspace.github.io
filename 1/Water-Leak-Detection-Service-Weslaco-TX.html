<p>Gas lines included external covers that are mainly made of plastic. Remove them to expose the gas pipes underneath. Put on a gas mask since breathing in such gases is dangerous for your respiratory system. Make sure to wear gloves as well. Electric water heaters likewise heat water inside a tank for circulation throughout your home. In this case, two electrical heating elements managed by private thermostats are responsible for heating the water inside the tank.</p>
