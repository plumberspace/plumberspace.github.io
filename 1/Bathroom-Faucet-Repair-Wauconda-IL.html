<p>Thank you so much for taking the effort to repair our water softener. over the vacations. We had actually been on trip during the time of repair and it was comforting to know it had been looked after and all set to go upon our return. For a plumber focusing on drain-clearing services, anticipate to pay at least $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. Many problems can be fixed in an hour. For weekend or night calls, include more to the per hour rate.</p>

Light-duty commercial-grade waste disposal unit start around $500-$ 2,500 and increase depending upon size, brand name and features.</p>
<p>Have actually utilized Plumb Crazy on three different events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a huge mess. They, similar to each person we have actually experienced with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, timely, and extremely experienced. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either small or large job plumbing work.</p>
