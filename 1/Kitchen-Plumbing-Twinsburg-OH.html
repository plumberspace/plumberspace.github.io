<p>When you rely on Roto-Rooter for water heater replacement, repair or maintenance, you can expect professional service from experienced plumbing experts. Backflow prevention gadgets operate by allowing water to flow in just one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, potable water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a building for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water backwards into the water system. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from cars and truck washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may flow in reverse into the potable water supply. To secure water quality, backflow security is required where the end user presents a risk of contaminating the city's water system.</p>
