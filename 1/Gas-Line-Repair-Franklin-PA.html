Usually, minerals arrive because groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants take a trip with the water until it is in your house. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange process to get rid of dissolved minerals that aren't as effectively eliminated by mechanical filtration. These materials are what causes tough water.</p>
