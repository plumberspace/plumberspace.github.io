<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Study compared cleaning agent dosage, water solidity, and washing temperature level to see if solidity had an impact on cleaning agent savings. The research study included tests that eliminated hard soils, in addition to examining filming and spotting. Scientists discovered that softened water utilizes almost 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans along with water at 10 gpg solidity level. That cleaning agent savings rises to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
