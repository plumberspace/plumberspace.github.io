<p>Discover the right water softener for you. One typical method for a house's water system to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue could spread greatly if that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in individual residences, it also prevents wastewater in private houses from receding out and contaminating the general public water supply.</p>
