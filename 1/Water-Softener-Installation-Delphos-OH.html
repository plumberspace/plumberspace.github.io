Repairs are the correct fix for problems such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little elements of the entire component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
