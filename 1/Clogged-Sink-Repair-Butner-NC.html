<p>The key to the technology is being able to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently eliminating firmness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Before installing, your professional will shut off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is gotten rid of and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is hooked up to its install. In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get precipitated.</p>

The resulting soft water supply is free of solidity ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
