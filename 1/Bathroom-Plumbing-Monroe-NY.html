<p>All you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) when you have actually discovered the journey lever you desire eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper way. When you've protected the trip lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
