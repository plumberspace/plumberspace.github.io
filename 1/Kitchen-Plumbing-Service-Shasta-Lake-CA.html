<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Shasta Lake CA 96019</h3>
<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and mixed with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
