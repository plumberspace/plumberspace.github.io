<p>We need to clarify a little terminology before we proceed with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly consists of an inlet and outlet shut off, properly located test cocks, and the necessary parts of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet). Each part can further be broken down into its parts. For instance a very first check belongs. An element can further be broken down into its private parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are put together to make parts, and elements are assembled to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
