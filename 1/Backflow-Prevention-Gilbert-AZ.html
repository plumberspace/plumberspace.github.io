<p>A malfunctioning garbage disposal, grease buildup, accumulated food and more can all add to a clogged kitchen sink.

<p>Backflow preventers are also needed by the plumbing code. Except within Coastline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities customers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County). The City of Shoreline is the plumbing authority within Coastline's city limitations. Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Shoreline when it comes to backflow preventer requirements.</p>
<p>Oregon state laws governing water supply need backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be removed.

The law also requires backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as mortuaries and medical facilities, in addition to commercial centers.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair costs may remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>
