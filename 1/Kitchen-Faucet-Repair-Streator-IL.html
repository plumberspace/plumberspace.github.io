Some components might have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
