<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be discovered near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks.

You may need to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
