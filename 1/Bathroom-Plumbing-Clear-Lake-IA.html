Over time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned.
