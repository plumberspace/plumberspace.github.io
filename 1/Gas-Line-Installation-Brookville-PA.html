<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Brookville PA 15825</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
