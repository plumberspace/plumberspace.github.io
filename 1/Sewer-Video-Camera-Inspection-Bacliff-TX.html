<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and meet our stiff trust certification requirements. An excellent general rule is to replace faucets that reveal corrosion, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Worn out and wore away parts make repairs pricey and difficult, meaning a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the proper fix for problems such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little parts of the whole fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
