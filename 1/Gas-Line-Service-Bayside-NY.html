<p>Galvanized piping is responsible for a minimum of half of the plumbing emergencies that we face in your houses around the Bay Area. The preliminary issues that occur are the staining of the water, with brown water coming out of a faucet that might have a nasty odor. It can also cause stains in clothing put in the washing machine. If your home is over 50 years old, it's a great bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and an optimum of $15,000. The wide variation in cost is because of the size of your home, the type of pipe you're setting up, and extra repairs you find you need to make any time you go behind walls.</p>
<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to remove high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that cause difficult water. The system filters out these hard water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to stream through plumbing when water flows through a Water Softener. State certified backflow technicians, available through your grass irrigation company or plumber can determine whether or not your equipment satisfies the requirements. The regulations also require a state certified backflow specialist test the backflow preventer yearly.</p>
