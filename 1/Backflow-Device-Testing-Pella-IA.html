<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in various parts of the plumbing system, many typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow concerns or perhaps stop a component from streaming entirely. The next common problem that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it lowers the available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>As we said, a waste disposal unit has a lifespan. Usually they will last in between ten and twelve years.
