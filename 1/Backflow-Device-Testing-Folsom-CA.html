PVC assemblies are a good option s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets before testing the drain.</p>
<p>Sewers, drains and waste piping are checked for correct grading to maintain downward flow. The plumbing system is tested for leaks.
