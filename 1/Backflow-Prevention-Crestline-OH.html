<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is just recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (normally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
