<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water supply and private on-site water supply and distribution systems by prohibiting cross-connections between safe and clean (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow methods offer an increased level of defense for the public water supply system.</p>
<p>Most plumbers will eliminate the old system to install the new one at the very same hourly rate. This can increase the amount of time needed to install the new system, therefore increasing costs.
