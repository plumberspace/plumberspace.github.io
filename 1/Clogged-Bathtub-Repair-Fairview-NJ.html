Bottom line: Tough water can make cosmetic and domestic cleaning products less reliable. This can result in inflamed skin or perhaps a broken washing machine. It's why a lot of cleaning items today consist of chelating agents or other kinds of water softeners.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
