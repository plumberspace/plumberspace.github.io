<p>When you count on Roto-Rooter for hot water heater replacement, maintenance or repair, you can anticipate professional service from skilled plumbing experts. Backflow prevention gadgets operate by allowing water to stream in just one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, potable water can stream both in and out of a structure or component. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a building for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water backwards into the water supply. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from cars and truck washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may get in the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might flow backwards into the safe and clean water system. To protect water quality, backflow protection is needed where the end user poses a threat of polluting the city's supply of water.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
