<p>Leakages are sly. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
