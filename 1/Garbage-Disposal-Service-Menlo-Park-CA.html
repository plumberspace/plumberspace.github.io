<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular event, however it does occur regularly than you think! When you don't discover the water was off for a few minutes, often it happens at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction projects quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
