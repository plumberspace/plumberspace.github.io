<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Bethlehem PA 18017</h3>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that should also be well preserved to assist prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to split and solidify or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the area along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so used that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
