Worn out and rusted parts make repairs expensive and tough, meaning a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the appropriate fix for problems such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little elements of the entire fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
