<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.
