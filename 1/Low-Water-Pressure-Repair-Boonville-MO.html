<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to eliminate chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and winds up in our lakes and streams.

Hydro-jetting is a sophisticated kind of drain cleaning where we utilize water under high pressure to completely clean out whatever inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and get rid of the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen up the green ground screw and eliminate wire ports. Disconnect garbage disposal wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp adapter and get rid of wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
