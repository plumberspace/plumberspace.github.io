<p>You observe rust in your water: If you begin to notice rust in your water, it could be an indication that you need pipe repair or drain repair services.

<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
