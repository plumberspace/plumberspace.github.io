<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
