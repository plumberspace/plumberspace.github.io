<p>Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable water supply within a building these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no way to supply one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>

The repair of a backflow preventer needs the specialist to have the needed understanding of how to identify the problem and bring back the backflow prevention assembly to its initial factory specs.

<p>There are 2 kinds of piping that are utilized in the repiping process. Since of their safety, cost and performance, copper piping and PEX piping are used. Copper piping avoids germs from growing inside of the pipe providing healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic product that is both versatile and lightweight.
