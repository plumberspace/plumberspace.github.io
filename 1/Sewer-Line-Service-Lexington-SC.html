This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is simply recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
