<p>If you're dealing with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and limitless home appliance repair costs, you need a water softener. Tough water is not a problem that will disappear on its own and the costs incurred by difficult water will just continue to escalate. With a water softener, devices will undoubtedly stop working quicker than their expected lifespan. Your flow rate will continue to restrict and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout the house if scale continues to accumulate in your pipes. Hard water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your energy expenses will continue to barrel skyward.
