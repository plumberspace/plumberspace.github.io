<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
