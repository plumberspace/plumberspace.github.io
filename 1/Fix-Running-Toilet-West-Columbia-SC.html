<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
