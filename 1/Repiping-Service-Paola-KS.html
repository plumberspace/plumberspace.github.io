<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as hard water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
<p>The issue of leak can be attributed to any variety of elements which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, as well as poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank need to have some room to account for the expansion that takes place. The thermal expansion needs to escape, for this reason the need for an expansion tank to assist control the pressure. The force applied by the expansion taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to crack and start leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The solution for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
<p>Get rid of all parts of the disposer set from package, and arrange the contents. Remove the P-trap and existing drain basket assembly carefully from the sink (Images 1 and 2). Place a large pan listed below the sink to catch water that might spill when you disconnect the drain, and keep a towel nearby to tidy up spills.
