<p>Spotty meals? Some underground seamless gutter drains end in the sewer system instead of at the edge of your yard.

<p>Lastly, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in crucial areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>

Another great technique is utilizing a drain strainer to keep out hair and soap residue from getting in your pipes.</p>
