<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that ought to also be well maintained to assist prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to break and harden or just be so crushed that it does not fill the area as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place.
