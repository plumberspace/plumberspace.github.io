<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Norfolk MA</h3>
<p>A recently installed hot water heater must not produce unusual sounds, but it will begin to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder over time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things get worse dramatically for families with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to bring back normalcy. A hot water heater replacement may be essential if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed.</p>
