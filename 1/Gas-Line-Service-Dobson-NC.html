<p>Once you have actually discovered the journey lever you desire, all you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct way. When you've protected the journey lever and are ready to connect your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
