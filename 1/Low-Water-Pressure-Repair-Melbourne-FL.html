Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
