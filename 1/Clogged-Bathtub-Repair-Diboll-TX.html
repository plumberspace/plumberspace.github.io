If you do not understand, invest the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or perhaps go into and break the line. If you are hiring somebody to plant for you, make sure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that he or she will also know the locations to prevent.
