Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct way. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are ready to attach your flapper, ensure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
