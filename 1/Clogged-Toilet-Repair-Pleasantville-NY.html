<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No hot water in your home? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your hot water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these problems, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement. While a few of these issues can be credited to normal wear and tear or improper installation, sometimes your waste disposal unit ends up being harmed by items that shouldn't be run through it.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, but if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a larger issue to examine. You might need to switch toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is reasonably new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing information.
