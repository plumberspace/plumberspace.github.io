<p>Run the warm water. Hot water is your pal, especially for your kitchen sink. Even if you are extremely mindful with what you put down your sinks, food residues and cooking oils still get away down our drains - particularly the kitchen sink. Running the hot water after you've utilized your sink helps clear particles and break up food and oils and keep your drain clear.</p>
<p>If the sink is no longer draining pipes as rapidly as it once did, there's a good chance it's since the waste disposal unit is clogged. Not only can a clogged disposal cause the sink to drain gradually, it can also cause unclean water to recede into the sink. A garbage disposal repair service can help identify and fix a clogged garbage disposal.</p>
