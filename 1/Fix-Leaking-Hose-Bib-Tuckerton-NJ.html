<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
