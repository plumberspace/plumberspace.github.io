<p>Metal alloys are vulnerable to an electro-chemical condition called rust. Rust can literally consume a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or alter the tolerances causing parts to not operate in a backflow preventer.

<p>Pro Suggestion: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the very best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; retrieve the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
