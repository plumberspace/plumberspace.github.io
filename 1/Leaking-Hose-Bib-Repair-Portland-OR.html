<p>Pro Tip: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the system, now is the very best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; retrieve the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
