Call Roto-Rooter today to see if trenchless sewer line repairs are the ideal option for your house or organisation.

<p>Replacing your flapper might need a little different actions than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To find an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, but possibilities are you'll locate among the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
