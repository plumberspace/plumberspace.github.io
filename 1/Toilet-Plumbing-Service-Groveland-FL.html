<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some homes were enabled to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the home. Generally, the water system to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
