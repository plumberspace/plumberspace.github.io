Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
<p>Switch on the gas and check connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mix bubbles, you have a leak.

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to hire a plumber for that burner set. The total repair expense might remain in the $300 variety.
