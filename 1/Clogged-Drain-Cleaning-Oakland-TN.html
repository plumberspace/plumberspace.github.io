<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular incident, however it does happen more often than you believe! Often it takes place at night when you do not discover the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately struggles with rust and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
