<p>Last but not least, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water streams at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>

Understanding the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
