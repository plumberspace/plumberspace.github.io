<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and satisfy our stiff trust certification standards. A good general rule is to replace faucets that reveal rust, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and wore away parts make repairs difficult and pricey, suggesting a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the proper fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the whole component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we suggest a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
