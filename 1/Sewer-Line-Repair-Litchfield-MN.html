<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Litchfield MN</h3>

<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Litchfield MN 55355</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending on the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>These are all indications that your unit should be examined by a plumber. We do not recommend attempting to repair this specific home appliance on your own, because it does provide a safety hazard, due to the sharp blades that are used to chop and grind waste. You must also prevent using any type of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal due to the fact that these chemicals will just damage the appliance further.</p>
