<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
