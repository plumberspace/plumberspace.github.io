<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In West Memphis AR</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
