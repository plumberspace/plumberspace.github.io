<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
