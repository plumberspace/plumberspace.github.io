<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities.
