<p>Sewer lines have one essential role: bring wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely pricey alternative.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, but if your toilet is obstructing more than three times a month, there's a larger issue to analyze. If your toilet is reasonably new, you may need to switch toilet paper or employ a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain.
