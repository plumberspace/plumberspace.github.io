However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many years, however steel eventually suffers from deterioration and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
