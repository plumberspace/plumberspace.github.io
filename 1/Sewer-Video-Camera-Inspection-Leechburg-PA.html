<p>Sewer lines have one crucial function: bring wastewater out of a home or building. Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely pricey choice.</p>

When discovered and replaced with another pipe product, galvanized steel pipes need to be eliminated by a professional plumber.</p>
