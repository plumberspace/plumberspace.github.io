<p>2 styles of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB might be used to separate health or non-health hazards but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>Once you've found the journey lever you want, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are prepared to attach your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
