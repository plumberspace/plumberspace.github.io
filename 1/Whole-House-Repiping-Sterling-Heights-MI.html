Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
