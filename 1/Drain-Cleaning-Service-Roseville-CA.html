<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, boiler, and heater, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these small deposits are harmless, but with time they build up and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads.
