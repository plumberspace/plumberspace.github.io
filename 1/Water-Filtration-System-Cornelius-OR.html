Some hard water problems are extremely noticeable, like dispensers and sprayers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go unnoticed, like scale on water heater elements and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Undetectable or visible, these problems have genuine expenses related to them.
