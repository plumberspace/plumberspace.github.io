<p>Examine to make certain it's not your waste disposal unit that's triggering the problem. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then check it to ensure it's running correctly. You might need to turn the switch found on the side or bottom of the system underneath the sink if the disposal has overheated.</p>
