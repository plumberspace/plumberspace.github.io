<p>When you've found the trip lever you desire, all you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank.

Remember that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the correct method. When you've secured the trip lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
