<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Roosevelt NY 11575</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
