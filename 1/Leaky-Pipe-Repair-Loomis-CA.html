<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.

Because the level of calcium carbonate implies little to water customers, water specialists have categorized levels of hardness. Table 1 shows these classifications.
