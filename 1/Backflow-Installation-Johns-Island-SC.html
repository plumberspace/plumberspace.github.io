Constantly continue to run water throughout and after utilizing your disposal. Preferably, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has disappeared down the drain.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash.

However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
