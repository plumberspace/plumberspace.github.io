<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
