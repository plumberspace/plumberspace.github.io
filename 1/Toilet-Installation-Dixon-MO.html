<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will eventually take its toll. If you discover that your plumbing experiences various blockages, leakages, and water pressure fluctuation that no amount of repairs seems to stem, you need to seek advice from a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as an option.
