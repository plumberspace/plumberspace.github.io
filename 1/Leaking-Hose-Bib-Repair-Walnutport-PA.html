Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners exchange the mineral ions of calcium and magnesium with salt or potassium. By reducing the mineral content, the system prevents scaling. The exchanged ions are then flushed out of your drain. Toilet service, like toilet repair, is something that everybody tends to delay up until it is an emergency. Nevertheless, there is absolutely nothing that can ruin your days like an out-of-service, leaking toilet or overflowing toilet.
