Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
