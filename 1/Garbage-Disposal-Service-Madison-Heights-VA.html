But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
