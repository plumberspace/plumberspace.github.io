<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>You hear water dripping or running in the tank. A backflow occurs when water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water supply.
