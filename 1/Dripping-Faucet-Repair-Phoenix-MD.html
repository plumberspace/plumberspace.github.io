<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and counts on a great balance of water pressure in order to work successfully. If your showers become frustrating, or it appears little to no water is draining of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair. The cost is dependent on the size of the home and the number of restrooms and plumbing components-- utility room, wet bar, mud room, and so on. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to access to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your final costs.</p>
