Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
