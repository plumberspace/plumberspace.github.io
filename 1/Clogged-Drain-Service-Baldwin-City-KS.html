A big scale buildup slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large build-ups of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life span. Scale deposits also collect to plug plumbing fixtures and build up in other home appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashers, thus affecting their performance.</p>
