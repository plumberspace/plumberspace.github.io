<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
