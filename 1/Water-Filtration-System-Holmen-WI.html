Excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
