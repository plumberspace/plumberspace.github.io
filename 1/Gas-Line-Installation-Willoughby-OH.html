New assemblies must be evaluated by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be offered to us. Get cleaner clothes, eliminate rust spots, and use less cleaning agent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house designs are appropriate for washing devices, or you can attempt laundry additive water softening items.</p>
