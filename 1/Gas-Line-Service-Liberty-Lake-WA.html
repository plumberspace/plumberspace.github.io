<p>Sewer lines have one essential function: bring wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a really expensive option.</p>
