<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Houses that were constructed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in homes that is not lead based). You may not desire to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>Longstanding Obstructions: Obstructions that continue after you have actually tried to repair them require professional support. Continued efforts on your own can harm your lines, and you might have a more severe underlying issue than you understand. Additionally, the longer you postpone to call for professional support, the greater the possibility that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
