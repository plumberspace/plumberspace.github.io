<p>Some states need steamfitters and pipefitters to be licensed; they might also need an unique license to work on gas lines. Licensing typically needs a test or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board to learn more. No, but you might have to coordinate with a Vectren representative to get to your residential or commercial property to perform service work, including relighting your gas appliances.</p>
