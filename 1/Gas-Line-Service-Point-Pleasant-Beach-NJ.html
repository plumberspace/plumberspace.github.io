Irrigation backflow prevention assemblies must be tested by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to ensure correct backflow prevention is in location to protect our drinking water during the irrigation season. Denver Water will send a testing suggestion notice one month prior to the yearly test is due.</p>
