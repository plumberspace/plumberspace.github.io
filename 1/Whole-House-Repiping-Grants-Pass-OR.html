<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>The area under your kitchen sink has gotten more congested for many years. Initially, there would have been a cold and hot water line increasing to the faucet (usually with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap. Using liquid epoxy-resin solutions, trenchless service technicians can cure in-place entire new sections of pipe within your harmed line, through little or perhaps pre-existing entry points.</p>
