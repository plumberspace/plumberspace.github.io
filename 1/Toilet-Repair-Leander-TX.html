Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
