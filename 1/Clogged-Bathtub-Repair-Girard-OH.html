In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically limit the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

A backflow prevention assembly includes an inlet and outlet shut off, appropriately located test cocks, and the required elements of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet).
