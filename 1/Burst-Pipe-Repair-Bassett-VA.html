<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
