<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
<p>The report will use one or both of these systems to inform you how tough your water is if you have your water checked. Given that the level of calcium carbonate indicates little to water customers, water specialists have classified levels of firmness. Table 1 reveals these categories. Double Check Valve assemblies are the most typical type utilized on irrigation systems in Horseshoe Bay.</p>
