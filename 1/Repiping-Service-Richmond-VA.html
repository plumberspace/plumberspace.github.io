<p>Sewer lines have one crucial function: carry wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive alternative.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
