The biggest of these primary long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
