<p>Video cameras are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing business. Determine the size of the water pipes in the home and around the home - they will help to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines need to be 3/4" to one inch straight from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in size to offer sufficient flow.</p>
<p>Next, check the body. Depending on the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again essential for the repair professional to be knowledgeable about the hardness of the materials so that their cleaning process is not devastating. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to reduce any scale growth or corrosion. It is very important that the repair technician is sensitive to the firmness and type of the various coatings used on iron body systems so as not to harm the protective covering.</p>
