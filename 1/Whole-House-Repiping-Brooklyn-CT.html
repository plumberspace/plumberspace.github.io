<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>To get rid of the smells, first attempt putting BioSmart (readily available at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can also try 1 cup lemon juice down the drain. After a couple of minutes, run warm thin down the drain. Insufficient or inaccessible cleanouts: No matter how reliable a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged at some point.
