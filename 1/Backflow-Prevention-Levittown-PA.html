Repairs are the proper fix for concerns such as missing or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
