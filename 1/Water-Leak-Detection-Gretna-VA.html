<p>CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) is one of the most typical kinds of plastic piping used in plumbing systems today. Among the reasons it's so popular is the cost, and it's understood to endure high temperatures. It is often utilized for warm water piping and drain pipes. Nasty smell: A strong, undesirable odor originating from your drains might suggest one of 2 concerns: food congesting the drain, or a larger issue in your sewage line.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
