<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes.

You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
