<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a viable service, particularly when easy plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>
