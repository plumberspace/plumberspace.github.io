<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Herndon VA 20171</h3>

Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
