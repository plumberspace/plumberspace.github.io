Prevent flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, together with versatile rubber traps. Particles can easily catch in this kind of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not offer necessary assistance for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a good choice s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make sure it sets before testing the drain.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
