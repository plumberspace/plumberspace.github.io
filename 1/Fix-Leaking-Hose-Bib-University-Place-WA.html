<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
