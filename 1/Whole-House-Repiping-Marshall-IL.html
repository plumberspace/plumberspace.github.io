<h3>Icemaker Box Replacement in Marshall Illinois</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have attained a breakthrough in water softening treatment utilizing an exclusive Surface area Accelerated Formation (SACr) technology.

In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to get in the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
