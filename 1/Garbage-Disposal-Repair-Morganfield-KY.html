When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, in addition to checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>

<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
