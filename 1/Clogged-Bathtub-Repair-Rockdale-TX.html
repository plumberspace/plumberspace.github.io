<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow direction within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical circulation in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Depending upon the degree of the clog, we may utilize a variety of different techniques, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is a sophisticated type of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to entirely clean out everything inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and get rid of the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen up the green ground screw and remove wire adapters. Disconnect waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp adapter and get rid of wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
