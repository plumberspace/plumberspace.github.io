<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Paramount CA</h3>

In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in homes were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Continuous blockages: If the plunger has actually become a routine component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous blockages show your toilet no longer has actually the power needed to successfully remove waste with each flush.</p>
