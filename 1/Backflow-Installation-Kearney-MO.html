<p>streaming backwards by blocking the flow using drifts or springloaded valves, and (3) vacuum breaker gadgets vent air from pipe to adjust the pressure and avoid siphonage. These gadgets are often integrated into single products to increase their effectiveness, such as double check valve assemblies (consisting of two successive independent check valves (DCVA)) and Reverse-pressure principle backflow preventers (2 inline check valves with a pressure relief valve located between them to dispose out any backflow water (RPD)).</p>
