<p>Finally, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
