<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating North Billerica MA</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. If enabled to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
