<p>Recurring obstructions or clogs that are very tough to clear might suggest a more significant issue than a basic clog.

<p>Switch on the gas and examine connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mix bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. When ended up, wipe the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work. Follow the how-to recommendations that accompanies the pictures to make sure the connections are tight.</p>
