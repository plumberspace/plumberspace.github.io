<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
