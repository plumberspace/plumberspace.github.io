<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is since the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
