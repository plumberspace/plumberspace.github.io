<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the faulty pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately experiences deterioration and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
