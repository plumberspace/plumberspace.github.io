<h3>Leaking Toilet in Pleasant Hill California</h2>
<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite instructions from its regular flow. IRWD's safe and clean water system is designed to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system deviate from "normal," the instructions of water circulation can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the potential for polluted water getting in the potable water distribution system.</p>
<p>While some problems can simply be fixed, others require a full replacement. If your toilet bowl is split or leaking, or if the valve assembly is shot, toilet replacement is the very best option for your problem.
