<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes.

If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
