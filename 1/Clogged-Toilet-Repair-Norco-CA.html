<p>In the 1990 â€² s, drought conditions motivated water companies to carry out water conservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in houses were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Constant blockages: If the plunger has actually become a routine fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant obstructions show your toilet no longer has actually the power needed to effectively get rid of waste with each flush.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden tubes: The highly hazardous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system. An extermination company employee had actually left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other connected to an external home hose bibb (outdoors spigot). When the water system system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through the house into the water supply.</p>
