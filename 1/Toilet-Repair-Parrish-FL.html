Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each element. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide might limit the motion (instead of constant or direct) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities.
