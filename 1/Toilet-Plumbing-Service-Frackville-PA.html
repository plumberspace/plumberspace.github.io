<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Frackville PA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
