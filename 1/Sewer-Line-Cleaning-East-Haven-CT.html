<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
