<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that relies on highly technical expertise and specialized devices to determine the area of leaks throughout the city's water distribution system and determine the area of those leakages at which noticeable water may or might not have actually appeared. Water temperature problems can be repaired by adjusting the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can simply loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can also be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>

Constant obstructions suggest your toilet no longer has the power needed to efficiently remove waste with each flush.</p>
