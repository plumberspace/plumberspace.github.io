Water temperature problems can be repaired by adjusting the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can simply loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can also be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>
