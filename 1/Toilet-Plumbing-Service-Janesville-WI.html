<h3>Tankless Hot Water Systems in Janesville Wisconsin</h2>
<p>A water softener removes minerals that create water solidity, one of the most common water quality problems a homeowner encounters. Difficult water ruins home appliances, leaves cloudy soap scum throughout cooking areas and restrooms, and dries hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States relying on hard water for their cooking, bathing, and cleaning, water softeners serve an important purpose. A water softener saves you from replacing too soon messed up water heaters, scaly faucet heads, and hours and hours of cleaning up soapy residue. Investing in a water softener saves you time, money, and energy, and protects your home and your property.</p>
<p>Some house owners might think about water softeners as a high-end item, something that's good to have" but not entirely needed. Nevertheless, difficult water can cause whatever from small annoyances, like areas on meals or soap residue, to significant problems like a much shorter life expectancy for your hot water heater, dishwasher, and other important home appliances. For these reasons and others, a water softener can be an useful financial investment for your house.</p>

A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the new heater.</p>
