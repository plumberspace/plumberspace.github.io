That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water features are considered a health danger. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location should be suggested on building plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond should be checked upon installation and after that yearly.</p>
