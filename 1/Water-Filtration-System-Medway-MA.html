<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or irreversible connection between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>There are 2 kinds of water softeners, a salt based water softener and a salt-free water softener Salt based water softeners will provide you more of the slick" sensation in the shower and you will see the soap developing more bubbles. Other benefits you will see include brighter colors in your clothing, minimized scale build-up on your showers and softer skin.</p>
