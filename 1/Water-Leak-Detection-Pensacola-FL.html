This is a kind of plastic resin that was widely used by contractors for houses integrated in the 1970s through the 1990s.

<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some houses were allowed to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of several toilets in the house. Generally, the water supply to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was presented into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water suppliers oversee these state requirements.
