<h3>When To Call A Plumber Ontario NY</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your backyard. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images caught by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden hoses: The extremely hazardous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system. An extermination company staff member had actually left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external house hose bibb (outside spigot). When the water system system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through the house into the water system.</p>
