<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Walnut Cove NC</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
