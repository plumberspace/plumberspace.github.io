<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are resilient in the short-term, they weaken over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to several kinds of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll begin to weaken from rust and might position contaminants into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the iron, steel, and clay pipes in your house. This may not need entirely repiping your house, given that newer materials may have already been utilized in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing.
