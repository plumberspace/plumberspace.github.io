<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No hot water in your home? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your hot water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these problems, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement. While some of these problems can be credited to normal wear and tear or incorrect installation, sometimes your garbage disposal becomes damaged by products that shouldn't be run through it.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
