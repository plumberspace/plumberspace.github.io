<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
