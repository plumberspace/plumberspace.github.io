<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
