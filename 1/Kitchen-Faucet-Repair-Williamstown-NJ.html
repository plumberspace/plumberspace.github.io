Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
