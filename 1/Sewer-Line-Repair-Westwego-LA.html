<p>Sewer lines have one essential role: carry wastewater out of a home or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely pricey alternative.</p>
