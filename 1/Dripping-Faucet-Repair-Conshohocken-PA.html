<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The specialist, Kenny, was polite, professional and useful! He asked me to look at the camera with him then discussed my options without attempting to oversell me!

<p>That stated, you don't always need to drain 10s of thousands of dollars on repairing your home's pipe or sewer lines.

<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furniture to safeguard them from water damage and dust during the work. They then locate the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls. They will only get rid of as much structure material as required to reach, detach, and get rid of the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To gain access to pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling listed below it. If you wish, you can arrange to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel.</p>
