<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to restore and enter the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
