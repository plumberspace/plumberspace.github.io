<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Anaconda MT 59711</h3>
<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is stored and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration instantly begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regrowth generally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
