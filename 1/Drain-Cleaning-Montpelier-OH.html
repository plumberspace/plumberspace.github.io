<p>We're replacing a natural gas hot water heater in our demonstration. The actions for replacing a lp hot water heater are exactly the exact same, and those for an electrical hot water heater are comparable. Recurring repairs and leakages.

When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
