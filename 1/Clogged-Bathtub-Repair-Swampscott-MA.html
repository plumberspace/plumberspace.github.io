<p>The Required Inspections Table shown below lists those inspections that must be carried out to validate that your work complies with the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. Please note that Virginia's Building Code prohibits using any plumbing fixtures or devices prior to approval of all needed inspections. We hope this list is advantageous to you throughout the course of your project.

<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
