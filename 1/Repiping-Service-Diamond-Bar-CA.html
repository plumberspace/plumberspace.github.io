<p>Backflow preventers are likewise needed by the plumbing code. Except within Shoreline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities customers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County). The City of Shoreline is the plumbing authority within Coastline's city limitations. Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Coastline when it concerns backflow preventer requirements.</p>

For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.
