They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs.

A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
