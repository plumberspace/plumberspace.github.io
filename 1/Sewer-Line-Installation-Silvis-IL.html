Atmospheric vacuum breaker. Although you may have a number of climatic vacuum breakers on your system, the water will just stream through one of them on its way to the sprinklers or emitters.

The majority of producers don't have pressure loss info for vacuum breakers, so assume a pressure loss of 2 PSI for a vacuum breaker if no maker's literature is readily available.</p>
<p>Distribution pipes transition to even smaller individual service pipes, bring water to individual houses, home buildings, stores and services. Depending on need, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches. Water goes into the customer facility through a water meter that tape-records flow rates and water utilization for billing functions. Specific service pipelines are usually made from lead, type or plastic K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be vital.</p>

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
<p>Turn on the gas and check connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mix bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten up or reconnect joints that leak. When ended up, wipe the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check out your work.
