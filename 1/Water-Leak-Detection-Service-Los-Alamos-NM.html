<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Los Alamos NM 87544</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
