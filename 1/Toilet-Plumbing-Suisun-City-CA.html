When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
