<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Companies in Lakewood</h2>

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
