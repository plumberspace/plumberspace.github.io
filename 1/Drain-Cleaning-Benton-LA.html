<p>When you count on Roto-Rooter for hot water heater repair, maintenance or replacement, you can anticipate professional service from proficient plumbing experts. Backflow prevention devices operate by permitting water to stream in just one direction. In an unprotected water service connection, drinkable water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water in reverse into the water supply. For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from vehicle cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray advancement might flow backwards into the drinkable water supply.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
