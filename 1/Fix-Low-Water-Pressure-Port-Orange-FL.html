<p>Separate the waste line. Remove the "P" trap waste line running from the disposal by using a wrench to unscrew the slip-nut connecting the disposal to the trap. You may wish to position a bucket under the trap to capture any wastewater being in the bottom. Routine maintenance can help avoid water heater failure and extend the life of your devices.

Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low.

For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
