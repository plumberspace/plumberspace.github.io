<p>The quality of your home's WATER matters. You do not want to worry about the woes of tough water, and with NuvoH2O, you no longer have to! Our tankless, natural citric acid water softener is the best-rated, salt-free water softener on the market-- that's why companies like Walgreens, HGTV, Popular Science, Panda Express, and more trust us to soften their water.</p>
<p>Oregon state laws governing water supply require backflow prevention assemblies to be set up on water services where cross connections can not be gotten rid of. Backflow assemblies are needed to be set up on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems. The law also needs backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as health centers and mortuaries, as well as commercial centers.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
