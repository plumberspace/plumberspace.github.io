<p>Ensuring plumbing devices such as sprinkler systems and fire pumps are isolated to their own respective networks is imperative in order to preserve safe and clean water security. When purchasing a home or flat, having a plumbing inspection is pretty standard. If it's a rental I have not seen a plumbing inspection done.  Again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In fact, if not done it can be among the most costly repair jobs if ignored. For instance, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is an issue, you may need all of your water piping replaced. Again, extremely expensive.

If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
