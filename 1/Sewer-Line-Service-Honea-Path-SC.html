<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and blended with water. , if you prepare to drain your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
