<p>Sinkholes do not only occur in your lawn, unfortunately, when a sewer line breaks. If there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running beneath your house's structure, the best you can hope for is to find out quickly.

<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by constantly bringing tanks on-line and off-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
