<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
