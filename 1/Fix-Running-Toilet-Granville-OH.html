Keep in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right way. When you've protected the trip lever and are ready to hook up your flapper, ensure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
