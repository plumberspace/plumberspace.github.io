Invisible or visible, these problems have actually real costs associated with them. Clogged fixtures trigger replacement or refurbishing costs and can irritate your clients. Scale accumulation in your water heater will inflate your energy expenses, and prematurely damaged RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement costs.
