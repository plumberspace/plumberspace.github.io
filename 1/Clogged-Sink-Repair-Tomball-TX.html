For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to break and harden or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the space along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain whatever remains in tip-top shape.</p>
