Continuous feed disposals are easy to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal debris can in some cases get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>

Over time, the product your drain is made from can start to wear away, degrade, and ultimately crack with typical usage, leading to a leak. You might have a leaking drain if there is water pooling under your sink or damp locations and signs of water damage.
