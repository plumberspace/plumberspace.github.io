It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
