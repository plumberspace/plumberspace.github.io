<p>Water heaters can be an expensive financial investment for house owners that they cope with for over a decade. That's why when it's time to equip your new house or replace your old water heater, it's important to think about the cost, performance, and durability of a brand-new system. Plumbers typically charge $45 to $65 an hour and can typically install a water heater in a day or in 6-8 hours.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.
