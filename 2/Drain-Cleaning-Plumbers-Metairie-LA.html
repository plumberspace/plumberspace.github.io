<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps catch wetness and sediment so that they do not go into the control system. Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to remove any sediment. A sediment trap might be included in a drip leg install.

These devices undergo testing by a qualified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In most cases, they go through regular tests later, too.</p>

<p>If your old disposal is broken beyond repair, you'll need to replace it. Although any broken device is frustrating to handle, the good news is that installing a replacement disposal will be less expensive than installing a new garbage disposal in a sink that has never ever had one in the past.

Each backflow prevention system needs different testing treatments and intervals, and needs considerable experience and knowledge.</p>
