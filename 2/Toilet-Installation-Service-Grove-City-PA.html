<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your backyard. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
