<p>Toilet repair tends to freak many people out a little, which is entirely understandable. Nobody wishes to mistakenly break something that might flood their bathroom with raw sewage. However, the majority of toilet repairs are straightforward and simple jobs - such as replacing a worn flapper - that most people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
