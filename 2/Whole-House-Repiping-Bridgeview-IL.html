<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Bridgeview IL 60455</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
