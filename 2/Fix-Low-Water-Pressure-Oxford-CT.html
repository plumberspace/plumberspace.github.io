In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in houses were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Constant obstructions: If the plunger has become a regular component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement.

<p>Usually, the cost to replace a toilet varies in between $ 122 and $228, with many property owners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the price of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour.
