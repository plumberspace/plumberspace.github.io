<p>Once a large sufficient source of water has been identified and assessed, the 3rd significant part of a water system system comes into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its consumers. The biggest of these main long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable coating, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. The majority of big cities need several aqueducts supplying water from geographically apart and varied sources.</p>
