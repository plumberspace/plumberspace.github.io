<p>As always, if you smell gas or presume a gas leak, leave the area immediately on foot. Do NOT utilize your phone, electrical switches, computer, or anything that could trigger a spark. Go straight to a safe place in a nearby home or structure, and then call 911 and CenterPoint Energy at 1-800-296-9815 or 612-372-5050 immediately. Position the water softener.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
