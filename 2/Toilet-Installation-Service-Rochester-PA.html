<p>Many homes or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the outer finish of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>

So, the greater per capita consumption" of water in rural areas may consist of considerable non-revenue water losses from their distribution pipelines.
