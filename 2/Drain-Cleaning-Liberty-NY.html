<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows occur from them, these water functions are considered a health hazard. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place should be suggested on construction plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond must be evaluated upon installation and after that yearly.</p>
