The most popular and standard design of hot water heater in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's neighborhoods is a gas or electrical tank unit.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can result in inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
