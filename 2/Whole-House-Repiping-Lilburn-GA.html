For weekend or night calls, add more to the per hour rate.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and online in action to the water demands of your carwash.

However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
