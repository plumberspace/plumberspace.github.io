Whether you're seeking to increase your house's eco-friendliness or simply plain tired of running out of hot water, a tankless hot water heater could be the perfect option for you.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continuously bringing tanks online and off-line in action to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, just one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
