<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi).

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical circulation direction within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping).

<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Salt Lake City UT</h3>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you select need to be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently noted should have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>Examples of backflow conditions include backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can save your plumbing system from unnecessary obstructions further down the water lines. In some instances, resins can not be washed of contaminants and will need to be replaced. (This should not hold true if the resin is periodically regenerated and maintained.) Consult your water softener dealer for details on resin replacement.</p>
