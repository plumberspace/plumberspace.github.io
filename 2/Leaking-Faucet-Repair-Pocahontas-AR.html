<p>Hard water usage may affect the efficiency of household appliances. When heated up, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater.

<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET used by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We advise, as a lot of plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly. Appropriate care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
