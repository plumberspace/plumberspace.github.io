<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Shakopee MN 55379</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
