For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
