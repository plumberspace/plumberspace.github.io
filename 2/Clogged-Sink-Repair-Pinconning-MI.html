But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly pictured.

That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
