<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in San Leandro CA 94577</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
