<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
