<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable solution, specifically when simple plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and household.</p>
