<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Wimberley TX</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
