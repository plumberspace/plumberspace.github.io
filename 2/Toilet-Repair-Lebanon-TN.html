Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content.

Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
