The need upstream might trigger a turnaround in flow.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
