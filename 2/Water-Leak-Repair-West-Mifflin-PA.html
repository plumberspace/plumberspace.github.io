<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services West Mifflin PA</h3>
<p>It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a properly functioning RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be supplied.</p>
