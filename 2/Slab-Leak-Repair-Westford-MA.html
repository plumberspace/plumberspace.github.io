<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your property. The camera is manually controlled on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light supplies a clear image for the service technician to precisely take a look at conditions and diagnose the functionality of the pipes. The details we obtain from the inspection permits us to make an informed decision relating to the condition of your pipes and suggest the best service too. We can make the ideal recommendation with self-confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned up of blockages or relined with epoxy resin.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it intends directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
