<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and significant leakages. We discover that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and better long-lasting service if you do have regular leakages.</p>
<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
