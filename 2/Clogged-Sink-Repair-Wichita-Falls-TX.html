<p>Examine the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to ensure it works. Inspect underneath to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of correctly. Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer used in new homes, but many homes constructed between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. When found and replaced with another pipe material, galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
