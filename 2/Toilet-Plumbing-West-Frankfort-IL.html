<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are installed in locations where water might cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>We offer Charlotte area Senior Citizens and Veterans a Discount rate of 10%, Anytime, on Any of our Plumbing Services. One method to evaluate for any leakages in your plumbing is to turn off all water devices in your home and outdoors (sprinklers, pipes, and so on).
