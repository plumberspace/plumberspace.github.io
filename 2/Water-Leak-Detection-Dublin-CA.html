<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if expensive) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
