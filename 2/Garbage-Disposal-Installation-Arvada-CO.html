<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Arvada CO 80004</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
