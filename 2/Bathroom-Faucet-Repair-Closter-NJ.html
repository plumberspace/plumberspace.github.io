<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is one of the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health danger or health threat conditions. They should be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not allow the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just secure versus back siphonage.</p>
