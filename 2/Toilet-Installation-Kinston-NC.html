<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
