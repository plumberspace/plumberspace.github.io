<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Flowood MS</h3>
<p>A freshly installed hot water heater must not produce strange sounds, but it will start to create rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things get worse dramatically for homes with a high need for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement might be required.</p>
