<p>Replacing your flapper may require a little different actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, but possibilities are you'll find among the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
