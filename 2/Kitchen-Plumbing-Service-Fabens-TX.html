<p>Doctor Fix-It is Denver's source for a professional toilet repair or replacement service. The whole house has polybutylene plumbing. This is a type of plastic resin that was commonly utilized by contractors for homes built in the 1970s through the 1990s. The problem with this type of plastic piping is it can end up being breakable and break quickly, specifically if your water is chlorinated or chemically treated.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is tight and intact, with no signs of leakage, you can probably leave it in place. Possibilities are excellent that the installing brackets on the brand-new unit will fit simply fine. To find out, eliminate the old disposal and install the brand-new flange on it. You can install the new disposal using the old flange if it fits.</p>
<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be discovered near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Just because copper is showing does not mean you do not have polybutylene pipes.
