Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
