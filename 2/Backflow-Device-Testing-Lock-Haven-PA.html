<h3>How To Choose An Exceptional Plumbing Service Lock Haven PA</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If allowed to return to the water system, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
