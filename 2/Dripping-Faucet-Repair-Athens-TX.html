<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are thought about a health threat if backflows take place from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location need to be shown on building plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond must be tested upon installation and then every year.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
