The sounds get louder over time as the heater goes to heat the water. Things aggravate drastically for homes with a high need for hot water.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
