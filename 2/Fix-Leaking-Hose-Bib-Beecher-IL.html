Our garbage disposal repair professionals can identify any issue that may arise with your unit, and we can help you select in between repair and replacement. Regular maintenance is an excellent method to do so if you want to stay ahead of repairs.</p>
<p>From beneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated correctly in the drain locknut, then tighten the drain and reinstall locknut. Finally, switch on the water and test for leakages.</p>
