<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Seneca SC</h3>
<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition defense. As the outer finish of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
