<p>This short article intends to resolve the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: an appropriately configured water softener does not make the cured water more destructive. Here are a couple of complicated truths that typically lead individuals to this incorrect conclusion. First, naturally soft water is typically corrosive.

<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
