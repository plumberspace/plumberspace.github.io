<p>Property owners typically forego maintenance and look after their waste disposal unit. We merely anticipate this workhorse positioned under the sink to operate as planned when we require it. That's not the case, though. Like any excellent plumbing system, the garbage disposal requires attention-- ideally, professional care.

<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to remove chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and winds up in our streams and lakes. In houses with personal wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic tank and after that ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>We'll show you 3 typical gas piping situations. We'll reveal you one way to make each connection, but there are other similarly genuine ways using typical plumbing parts. Do not be confused by the labels FIP and MIP; they just represent female pipe threads and male pipe threads, respectively. And when you buy the parts, don't think twice to ask for aid. Then screw all the gas line parts together to make sure they fit.</p>
<p>There are more than 17,000 backflow prevention assemblies on water services in our service area.
