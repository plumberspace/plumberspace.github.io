<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Thompsons Station TN</h3>
<p>A newly installed hot water heater should not produce unusual noises, however it will start to create rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things worsen considerably for homes with a high need for warm water. The factors for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be required.</p>
