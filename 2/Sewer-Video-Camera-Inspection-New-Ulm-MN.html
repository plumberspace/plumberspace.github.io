<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water.
