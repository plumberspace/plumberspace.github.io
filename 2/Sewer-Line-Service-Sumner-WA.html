<p>When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on really gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close appropriately. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
