Decreased Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the first check valve.</p>
