<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to employ a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair bill might be in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800).
