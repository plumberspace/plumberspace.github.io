<p>Two styles of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB might be used to separate health or non-health hazards but works versus back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean.

Regeneration automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth generally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
