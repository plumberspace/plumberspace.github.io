<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can likewise be challenging to repair as they are normally situated behind the sink, in cramped areas. The best way to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches take up too much area and need a large swing angle, which may be tough to acquire in little spaces.</p>
