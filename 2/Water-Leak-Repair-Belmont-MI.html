Repiping plumbing lines in your house is a big task - and it's a job you want to get right. But the range of plumbing pipe materials to select from can make it complicated.

NOTE: If defective work is found, the inspector will provide an infraction notification, and a specific time period is allotted to correct the issue.</p>
<p>The easiest solution might appear to be just disregarding the problem or using a do it yourself chemical service. However, this is a short-term fix and may trigger more damage. Some pipe products, like copper or cast-iron, are delicate to chemicals. Chemical cleaners can corrode and deteriorate your pipes, causing significant leaks, cracks, and large damages.</p>
