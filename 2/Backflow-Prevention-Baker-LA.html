Backflow prevention devices run by allowing water to flow in just one instructions. In an unprotected water service connection, safe and clean water can stream both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a building for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water backwards into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from cars and truck washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might get in the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may flow in reverse into the potable water supply. To secure water quality, backflow defense is required where the end user presents a risk of polluting the city's supply of water.</p>
