First of all, if your current water heater is old, you'll enjoy better effectiveness and decreased month-to-month expenses with a newer, contemporary system. Secondly, if you've had to pay out for your regular hot water heater repairs, changing your water heater can save you time, money, and trouble with fewer breakdowns and problems.

For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
