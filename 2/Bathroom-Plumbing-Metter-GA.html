<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<p>PEX is made from a versatile piping material that is easy and inexpensive to install and is resistant to acidic compounds.

Over time, sinks can also get dings, chips and scratches that can destroy their visual appeal. Gauges in porcelain sinks can start to rust. Expect to pay between $100 to $200 to resurface these imperfections.</p>
<p>The actual process of setting up a disposal needs to be made with caution. Because you are dealing with blades, electrical power, and water, there are dangers involved. There are also quite a few tools and materials involved which you may not have.
