If the pipes that need to be repaired run below landscaping or beneath your house or structure.

<p>Is your water bad or stinky tasting? Is the water from your cold water tap warmer than you wish to consume? A water filtration system with chiller will supply you with cool, clean, yummy water for every glass. At Bonney Plumbing, we understand the satisfaction of a rewarding drink of water. So, we concentrate on installation, repair and service of water purification systems and chillers for any application.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
