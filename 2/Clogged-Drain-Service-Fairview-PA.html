<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
<p>Demand loads, no matter what their usage, need to be met by an adequately sized water supply, which constitutes the 2nd significant component of a water supply system. With appropriate tank capability to fulfill variable peak load need, the water system source can offer a stable circulation of water. Throughout hours of low demand, the water circulation can be utilized to fill up storage cisterns, tanks and towers, which then provide water for emergency usage and durations when need exceeds the baseline pumping rate. A water system source can take many types, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, manufactured or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
