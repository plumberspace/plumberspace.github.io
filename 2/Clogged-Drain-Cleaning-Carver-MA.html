<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle often. When your water lines are repiped, it simply suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing major and frequent leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping. If you do have frequent leakages, we find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and better long-term option.</p>
