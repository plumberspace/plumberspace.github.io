The temperature level and pressure relief valve is a safety device that restricts tank pressure and keeps it from blowing up (Photo 4). A brand-new one must be included with every installation. For the valve to work appropriately, the discharge pipe should be kept without blockages (Fig. A).</p>
<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals.
