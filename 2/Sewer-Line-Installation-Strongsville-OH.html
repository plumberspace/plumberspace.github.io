<p>Plastic pipe is in large usage for domestic water system and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to make up until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established an approach to plasticize PVC, making it much easier to process. PVC pipe started to be made in the 1940s and was in wide usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The technique for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was likewise established in the 1950s.
