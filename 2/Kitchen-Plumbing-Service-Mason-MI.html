<p>Sewer lines have one important role: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the issue became worse. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive choice.</p>

Clogged components cause replacement or reconditioning costs and can frustrate your clients. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy costs, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement expenses. Quickly, these little costs can add up to make a real effect on your bottom line.</p>
