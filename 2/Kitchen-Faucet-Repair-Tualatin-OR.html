Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.
