<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, examine the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is cheap and easy. But finding the right washer may not be. The most typical washers are often offered at home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be tough to discover. Eliminate it and take it to the store to discover a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers not conforming to these rules for an offered application and which are worn out or broken and require replacement should be replaced by a backflow preventer which does comply to the rules for the provided application.
