<p>These valves have a lot of versatility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention options, but they also supply the least quantity of security. A climatic vacuum breaker, also known as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. When pressurized and drops to permit air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc increases and seals off the air inlet.</p>
<p>Common areas where backflow presenters are required are swimming pool automated refill lines, refill lines for garden ponds and decorative water fountains, and landscape irrigation systems.

<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does happen more frequently than you believe! When you don't see the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it happens at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Broken pipes become very more costly to fix as the rate of the flow of the broken pipe grows.
