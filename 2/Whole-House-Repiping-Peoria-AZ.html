<p>Mold Development: Mold development is another regrettable negative effects if you need a sewer line fixed. When you also have an odor of sewage along with it, this is most common.

<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be eliminated and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. It is necessary that only initial factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts.
