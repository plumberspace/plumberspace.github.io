Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
