However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does happen regularly than you believe! Typically it takes place during the night when you don't observe the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a new pipe. This makes building projects easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
