<p>CPM Plumbing focuses on speedy service, precise troubleshooting, and precision repairs so your service never ever has to suffer from downtime. If there is a leak, one thing to know about gas lines is they can be exceptionally hazardous. While gas leakages are uncommon, you need to get out of the building immediately if you see an odor like rotten eggs in your property. A gas leak can have almost instant effects on those exposed to it, and it can even be deadly. If you've got a gas pipe leaking, leave your house and call us instantly.</p>

Water pressure may be or stop working lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high need on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
