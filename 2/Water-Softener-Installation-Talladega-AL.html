<p>Minerals in water are what makes sure water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals discovered in water. Generally, minerals get there due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water until it is in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to get rid of dissolved minerals that aren't as effectively removed by mechanical filtration. These materials are what causes tough water.</p>
<p>It's essential to be mindful that many scale and mineral accumulation in toilet bowls is caused by hard water if your problem is more related to scale and mineral accumulation. Difficult water generally leaves lime and calcium accumulation which can become rather unattractive. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning approaches will certainly help, we highly suggest you look into setting up a water softener to aid with your tough water.</p>
