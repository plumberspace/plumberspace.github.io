<p>Minerals in water are what ensures water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most typical minerals found in water. Typically, minerals arrive due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants take a trip with the water until it is in your home.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
