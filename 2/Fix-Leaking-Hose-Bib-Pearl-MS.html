<p>Responsive flow technology works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and on-line in reaction to the water needs of your carwash.

However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
