<p>A Pilot Light That Has Actually Headed out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you utilize a gas water heater rather than a system with an electrical heating element, there is a great chance your pilot burner has actually headed out. This could be due to the fact that of a problem with your thermocouple, a lack of combustible air, or just a strong breeze. Regardless of what the concern is, nevertheless, your hot water heater will not be able to function until the pilot light is re-lit.</p>
<p>The problem of leak can be attributed to any number of elements which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance.

If the tank is old and broken, the force put in by the expansion happening when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to crack and start leaking. The solution for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
