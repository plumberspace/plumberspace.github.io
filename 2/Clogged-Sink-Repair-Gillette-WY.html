<p>CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) is one of the most common kinds of plastic piping used in plumbing systems today. Among the factors it's so popular is the cost, and it's known to hold up against high temperatures. It is frequently utilized for warm water piping and drain pipes.

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent.

This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
