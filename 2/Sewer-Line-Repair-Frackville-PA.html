<h3>Water Heater Leaking in Frackville PA 17931? How to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
