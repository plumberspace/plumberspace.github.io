<p>Once a big adequate source of water has actually been determined and evaluated, the 3rd significant component of a water supply system enters play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its consumers. The largest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are described as aqueducts. Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
