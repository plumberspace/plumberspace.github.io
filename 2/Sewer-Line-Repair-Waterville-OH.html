Rather than removing the clog with negative pressure, it really pushes into the obstruction, working even more into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
