<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
