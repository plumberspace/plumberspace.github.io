<h3>Types Of Blocked Drain Cleaning Equipment in Kennebunkport ME 04046</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
