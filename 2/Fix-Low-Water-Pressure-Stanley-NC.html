Whole-house designs are suitable for washing makers, or you can attempt laundry additive water softening items.</p>

<p>Pro Tip: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the very best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; recover the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
