<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the outer covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
