<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most typical sink repair problems. Common adequate that many people opt for do-it-yourself repairs. But in some cases even recognizing the leak can be a problem. It could be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, garbage disposal fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
