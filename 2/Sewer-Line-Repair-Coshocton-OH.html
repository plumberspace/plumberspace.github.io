Sink problems can be a real inconvenience, and they can leave you guessing about what to do. If you occur to have a store vac it will be simpler to get rid of the water with it rather.  Often times you may even be able to unclog the drain by holding the nozzle close to the drain as you suck out the water.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi).

If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
