<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Antioch CA</h3>
<p>We're replacing a natural gas hot water heater in our presentation. The actions for changing a lp water heater are precisely the very same, and those for an electric hot water heater are comparable. Recurring repairs and leakages. If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has actually likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run. As a result, we advise replacing your system if it is over 10 years old.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great man. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as assured. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be greater.</p>
