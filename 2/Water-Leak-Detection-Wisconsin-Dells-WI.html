The biggest of these main long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Typically constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. The majority of big cities need numerous aqueducts providing water from varied and geographically separated sources.</p>
