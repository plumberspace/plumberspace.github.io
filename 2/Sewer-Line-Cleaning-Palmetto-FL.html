If you have had plumbing service prior to planting, you might have a concept of where your lateral is located. If you do not know, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, and even dig into and break the line. If you are working with someone to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the locations to avoid. Your line will be easy to recognize if you have a clean-out.</p>

Sometimes it may be needed to filter the water before it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin ends up being fouled. Cleaners need to be used according to manufacturer guidelines to avoid contamination.</p>
