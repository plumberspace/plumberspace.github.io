For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>

In this approach, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
