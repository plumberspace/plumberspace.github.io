The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project.

So we recommend installing or fixing water pressure regulators to protect your whole home.</p>
