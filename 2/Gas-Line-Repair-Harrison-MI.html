It could be in need of major repairs or it could be nearing the end of its life-span if your disposal is often making sounds that are abnormal for the machine. Frequent clogs, even when you're barely washing down any food particles, might indicate a problem with the disposal. If there are leaks originating from your system, it is most likely due to excessive use over an extended period of time. A lot of these leaks can be fixed, but if they become bigger and more frequent, you need to think about total system replacement.</p>
<p>We do warm water heaters setups and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties. In more major cases, such as tree roots that have actually grown into your main sewer line, you may need more comprehensive repairs.
