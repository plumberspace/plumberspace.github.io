When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
