<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have attained a breakthrough in water softening treatment using an exclusive Surface Accelerated Formation (SACr) technology. SACr physically gets rid of short-lived hardness without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are major restrictions of present softening innovations.</p>
