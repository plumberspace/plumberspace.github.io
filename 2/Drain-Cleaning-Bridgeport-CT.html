<p>We're replacing a natural gas hot water heater in our demonstration. The steps for changing a lp hot water heater are precisely the very same, and those for an electrical water heater are comparable. Repeating leakages and repairs. If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run.

If your set just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.

Similar to with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
