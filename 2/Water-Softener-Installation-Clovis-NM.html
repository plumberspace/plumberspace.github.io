<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
