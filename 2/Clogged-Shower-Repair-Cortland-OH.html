<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No hot water in your home? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these concerns, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement. While some of these issues can be credited to typical wear and tear or incorrect installation, often your waste disposal unit ends up being damaged by products that shouldn't be run through it.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing specialists can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by connecting a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might offer a fast fix in the short term, it can trigger much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler generally are set up in locations where water could trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
