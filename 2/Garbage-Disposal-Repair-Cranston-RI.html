<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will accumulate in different parts of the plumbing system, many commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low circulation issues or even stop a fixture from streaming completely. The next typical concern that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it minimizes the offered volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are set up in big, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is launched, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
