<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the part, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
