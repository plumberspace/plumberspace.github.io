<p>This short article intends to resolve the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: a properly set up water softener does not make the cured water more destructive. Here are a couple of confusing facts that often lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is normally corrosive. Therefore, softened water must also be destructive, ideal? This is a fallacy since naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>

Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent incident, however it does happen more frequently than you think! Typically it takes place in the evening when you do not observe the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a new pipe. This makes building jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems.
