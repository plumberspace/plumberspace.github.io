<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Scranton PA 18504</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>

Idea: Place a heavy item such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation.

Trying to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are deteriorating slowly from the within.
