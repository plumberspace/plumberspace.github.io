<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
