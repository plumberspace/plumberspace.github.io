<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers need to be able to lift and move heavy tools and products. Pointer: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen up the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal.

You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it.
