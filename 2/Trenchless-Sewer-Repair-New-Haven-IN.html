<h3>Water Heater Leaking in New Haven IN 46774? The Way to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
