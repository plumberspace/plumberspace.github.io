<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
