<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
