A conventional tank water heater generally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before requiring a replacement, while a tankless water heater can last up to 20 with correct maintenance and care.

<p>Firstly, never ever plant anything up against your house, in front of windows, nor near your lateral. (Your lateral is the significant line from your home to the city line.) You may have an idea of where your lateral is situated if you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not understand, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, or even dig into and break the line. If you are hiring somebody to plant for you, ensure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the locations to avoid. If you have a clean-out, your line will be simple to recognize.</p>
