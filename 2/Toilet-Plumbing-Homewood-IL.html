<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
