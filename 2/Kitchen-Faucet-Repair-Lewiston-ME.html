<p>Check the washer for wear or cracks when you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is easy and inexpensive. But finding the right washer may not be. The most typical washers are frequently readily available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be tough to discover. Eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
