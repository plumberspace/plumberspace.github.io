<p>Once a large adequate source of water has been recognized and examined, the 3rd major part of a water supply system enters into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its consumers. The largest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Usually constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. The majority of big cities need a number of aqueducts supplying water from diverse and geographically separated sources.</p>

<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your yard. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
