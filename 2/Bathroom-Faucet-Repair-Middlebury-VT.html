For gas water heaters, a particular gas line needs to be set up and a viable source of gas developed. Another function of an electrical water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas designs need to be ventilated effectively using vents and ducts in order to function correctly. With electrical designs, you will not need to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
