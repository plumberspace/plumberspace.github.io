<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they degrade over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to many different types of rust. After about fifty years, they'll begin to weaken from rust and might put toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We recommend replacing the clay, steel, and iron pipes in your house. This might not require totally repiping the house, since newer products might have already been used in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you determine precisely what work needs to be done.</p>

The regulations also require a state certified backflow specialist test the backflow preventer every year.</p>

They are extremely knowledgeable, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would definitely advise them to my household and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in the house.</p>
