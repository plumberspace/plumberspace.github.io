<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to hire a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair costs may remain in the $300 variety.

That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>
