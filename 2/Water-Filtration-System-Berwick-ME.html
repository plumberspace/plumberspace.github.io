But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
