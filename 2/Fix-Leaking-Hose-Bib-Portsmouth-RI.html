<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement in Portsmouth RI 02871</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
