I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back due to the fact that he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>
