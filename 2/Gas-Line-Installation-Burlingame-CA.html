<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
