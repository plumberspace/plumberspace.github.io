<p>Leakages are sly. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Sewage systems, drains and waste piping are looked for appropriate grading to keep downward flow. The plumbing system is evaluated for leaks. We check that the product utilized in the plumbing system is approved by a recognized testing lab.

We also inspect the vent pipes to balance the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>
