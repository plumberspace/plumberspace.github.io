<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and fulfill our rigid trust certification requirements. A good general rule is to replace faucets that show deterioration, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and rusted parts make repairs hard and costly, meaning a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the appropriate fix for problems such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little parts of the entire fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
