Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.

<p>Lastly, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five separately running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline.
