That implies if something fails later, you will have somebody who can fix it without any added expenses. The alternative do-it-yourself (DIY) approach offers no such warranties, and in many cases unless you know a lot about plumbing, there's a quite significant danger that you might do more damage. When that occurs, you will most likely need to call a plumber anyway to fix your errors, and possibilities are they will cost more and be more difficult than if you had just called a professional in the first place.</p>
