<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, however it does take place regularly than you think! Typically it occurs during the night when you do not see the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building projects easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
