<p>It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an effectively operating RPZ assembly to periodically discharge percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas subject to water damage. Adequate drainage must also be provided.</p>
