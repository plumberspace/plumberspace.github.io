<h3>Drains Blocked Find A Good Emergency Plumber Now Scott LA</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>To make placing a toilet much easier, brand-new toilet bolts are extra long. That implies you need to cut off the protruding ends later with a hacksaw. But very first connect the water line, flush the toilet a number of times and look for leaks. Leaving the bolts uncut until you've done these last checks lets you easily reset the toilet and get rid of if you find any problems.</p>
