<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Grayson GA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Another way to deal with a clog is by using a chemical cleaning product or if you fear they might be too severe on your pipes, you can attempt old natural home remedy like warm water, vinegar, and baking soda. Call Plumb Perfect Plumbing and ask about our clogged toilet repair service if you have actually attempted whatever and the clog stays.
