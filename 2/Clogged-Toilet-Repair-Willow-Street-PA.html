<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Willow Street PA</h3>
<p>Strange Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably requires a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to go through. The pipes often make unusual gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight area. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, leading to the odd noises originating from your sink.</p>
<p>Inspect the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make sure it works. Examine below to be sure there aren't any leakages. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of properly. Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer used in new houses, but many homes built between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. When found and replaced with another pipe product, galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber.</p>
