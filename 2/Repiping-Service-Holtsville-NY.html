We service pipelines throughout the state of Georgia, from Atlanta to Athens, Savannah to Augusta, Macon to Marietta, GA, and beyond.</p>
<p>Turn on the gas and inspect connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. You have a leak if the mixture bubbles. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. When finished, wipe the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check out your work. Follow the how-to guidance that accompanies the photos to make sure the connections are tight.</p>

<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
