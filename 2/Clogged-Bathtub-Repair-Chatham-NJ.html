<p>Camera are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing organisation.

If scale continues to build up in your pipes, your flow rate will continue to limit and you risk losing water pressure throughout the house. Tough water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your utility expenses will continue to barrel skyward.
