<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically two layers of security. The device allows water to press the check valves open when water is entering into the structure, but closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong way. There are 2 various types of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are typically specified-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a few others that I will discuss but do not get hung up on them. Since they will be on an accreditation test, I mention them only.</p>

<p>Finally, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
