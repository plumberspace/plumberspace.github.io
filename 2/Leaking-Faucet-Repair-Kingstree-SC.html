<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is.

After that the softener can be detached, relocated to its new area and put there.</p>
