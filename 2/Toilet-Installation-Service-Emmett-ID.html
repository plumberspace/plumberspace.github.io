<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is simply catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (normally sodium or often potassium).</p>

The majority of fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Normally, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  No matter the operating mechanism, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>
