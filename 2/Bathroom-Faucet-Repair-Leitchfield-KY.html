<p>Difficult water usage might impact the performance of household devices. When heated up, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A large scale accumulation slows the heating procedure and needs more energy to heat water. Water heaters with big build-ups of mineral accumulation will have a much shorter life span. Scale deposits also build up to plug plumbing components and build up in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashers, therefore impacting their efficiency.</p>
