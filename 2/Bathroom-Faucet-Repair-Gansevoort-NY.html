<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
