<p>Leakages - If your hot water heater is leaking, you may need to replace the system. Gradually leaks can cause other concerns and even trigger mold to grow around the unit. If you see a leak, get it fixed as soon as you can. Linking watering to water fountains, pool and garden ponds restricted: State law and City regulation hold that no irrigation system may be connected to a water fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond.
