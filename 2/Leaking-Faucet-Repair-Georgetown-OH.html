<p>It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly working RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in locations based on water damage. Appropriate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
