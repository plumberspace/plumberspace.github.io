<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
