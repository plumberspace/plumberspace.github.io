<h3>Water Heater Leaking at Emeryville CA 94608? The Way to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
