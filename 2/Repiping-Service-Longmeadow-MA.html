A backflow prevention assembly consists of an inlet and outlet shut down, properly situated test dicks, and the required parts of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet). Each part can further be broken down into its parts. For example a first check belongs. A component can even more be broken down into its private parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are put together to make parts, and components are assembled to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
