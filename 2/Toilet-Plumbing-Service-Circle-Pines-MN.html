Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Most big cities need several aqueducts providing water from geographically separated and diverse sources.</p>
