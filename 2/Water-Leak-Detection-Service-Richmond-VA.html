As difficult water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause hard water stay with the beads, and the treated water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
