<h3>Clogged Drain Services at Boerne TX 78006</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>

<p>Tankless electric hot water heater can be found in 2 types. There are whole-house heaters that are effective and big enough to provide hot water to all restrooms, kitchens, and devices in a home. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electric heaters that provide hot water to specific spaces or home appliances only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the exact same way. The only difference is the quantity of water they can heat up at any provided time. Also, whole-house systems are significantly more expensive than the point of use systems.</p>
