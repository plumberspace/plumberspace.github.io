<h3>Garbage Disposal in Hyrum Utah</h2>
<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were used for home plumbing.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
