The most popular and standard style of hot water heater in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's neighborhoods is a gas or electric storage tank system. These units save simply the correct amount of hot water for your benefit. If you are looking to conserve more energy and lower your water bill, a tankless water heater would be best since it just heats up water, as you use it not when you don't.</p>
