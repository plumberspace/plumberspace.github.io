<p>Sewer lines have one essential function: carry wastewater out of a home or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the issue got worse. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a really expensive option.</p>
<p>Repair leaky eves that could leak water onto the meter and freeze. Since they shred food waste into pieces little enough to pass through plumbing, Garbage disposal units are helpful.
