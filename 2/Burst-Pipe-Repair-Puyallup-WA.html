<p>Thank you a lot for taking the effort to repair our water softener. over the vacations. We had been on trip during the time of repair and it was soothing to understand it had actually been taken care of and prepared to go upon our return. For a plumber specializing in drain-clearing services, expect to pay a minimum of $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. Many problems can be fixed in an hour. For weekend or night calls, include more to the hourly rate.</p>
