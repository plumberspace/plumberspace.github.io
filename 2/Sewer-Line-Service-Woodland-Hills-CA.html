However, some sinks do not have a plug-in installed beneath, and it may take an electrical expert and even permits to get one set up on its own dedicated circuit.</p>

A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regrowth processes. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is likely cracked and merely needs to be replaced if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
