When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If enabled to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, as well as checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
