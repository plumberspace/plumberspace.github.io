There are only a lot of repairs that you can make before you need a new toilet, right?

<p>Lastly, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in crucial locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
