<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring energies or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.

Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
