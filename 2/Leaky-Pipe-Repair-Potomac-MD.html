<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a practical option, particularly when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
