<p>Responsive circulation technology works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and on-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, just one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
