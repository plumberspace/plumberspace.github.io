<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
