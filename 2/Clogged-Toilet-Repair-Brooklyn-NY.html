<p>106.2.2.1 Besides Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent rule exclusions in Section 106.2.2 shall be applicable to small repairs and replacement piping only. In structures besides Group R-3 occupancies, an authorization and inspection will be needed for more comprehensive work if more than 10-percent (nominal) of a floor area, wing, or level is involved, despite the fact that the floor level, wing, or area defines less than 10-percent (small) of the total building plumbing.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it need to be much less water.</p>
