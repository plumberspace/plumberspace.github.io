<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
