<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complex scientific procedure, but simple to correct. It uses salt to get rid of odors and minerals found in tough water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attach and bring in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
