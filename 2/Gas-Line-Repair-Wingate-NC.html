<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and blended with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).
