<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby energies or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
