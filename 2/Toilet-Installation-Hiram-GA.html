<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Hiram GA</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
