Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
