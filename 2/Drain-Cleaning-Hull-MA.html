<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
