When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. There is capacity for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply.
