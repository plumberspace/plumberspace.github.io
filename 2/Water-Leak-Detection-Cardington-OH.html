A large scale accumulation slows the heating procedure and needs more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large build-ups of mineral buildup will have a shorter life span. Scale deposits also accumulate to plug plumbing fixtures and build up in other home appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashers, hence affecting their efficiency.</p>

<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your yard.
