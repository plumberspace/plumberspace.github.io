<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
<p>Backflow preventers not adhering to these guidelines for a provided application and which are worn or broken and require replacement should be changed by a backflow preventer which does comply to the guidelines for the given application.

<p>It's a strangely complex scientific process, but easy to correct. It uses salt to eliminate minerals and odors discovered in hard water- most frequently calcium and magnesium.

Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
