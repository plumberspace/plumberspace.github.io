<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Video cameras are among the most important tools in the plumbing business. Figure out the size of the water pipes in the home and around the house - they will help to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be sufficient, the lines ought to be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in diameter to offer sufficient flow.</p>
<p>To connect a power cable to the brand-new system, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cord, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing plans are not required for one- and two-family houses or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
