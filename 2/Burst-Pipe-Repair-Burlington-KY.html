<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
