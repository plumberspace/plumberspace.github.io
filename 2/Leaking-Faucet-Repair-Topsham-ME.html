Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, wearing away the sidewalls and only partly repairing the issue. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively seek out natural product and eat away at it, developing harmless by-products of carbon water, mineral, and dioxide ash, all of which are quickly dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
