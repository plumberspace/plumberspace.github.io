<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe at Somerset MA 02726</h3>
<p>The most convenient method to keep you and your household safe from the possible dangers of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the first location. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, pool, water function or other type of cross connection, have an authorized backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are installed in large, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
