When purchasing a home or flat, having a plumbing inspection is pretty standard. If it's a leasing I have actually not seen a plumbing inspection done.  Once again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In fact, if not done it can be among the most costly repair jobs if neglected.
