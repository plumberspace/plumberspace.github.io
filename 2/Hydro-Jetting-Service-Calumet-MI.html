<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener.

<p>The normal option is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately experiences rust and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
