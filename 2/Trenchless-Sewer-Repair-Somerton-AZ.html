<p>Leaks are sneaky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften difficult water.

WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
