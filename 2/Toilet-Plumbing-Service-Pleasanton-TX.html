<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows occur from them, these water functions are considered a health threat. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location should be indicated on building and construction strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond should be evaluated upon installation and then each year.</p>
<p>We will find the leak and shut the gas line down at the main line if it has not already been finished if there is a leak. Then, our technician will dig to discover the gas line and leak. The gas line will be replaced and pressure checked to make sure there are no leaks. If the leak is adequately repaired, the site will be cleaned up and brought back to its previous elegance.</p>
