<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Westminster MA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Likewise known as cabling, we snake a coiled metal wire down the pipe while we rotate on our end to unclog drains. This approach works best for cleaning out drains clogged with hair and debris, such as showers and sinks. Backflow is the flow of water in the wrong direction from a consumer's water supply into the general public supply of water. Backflow may be brought on by back pressure or back siphonage.</p>
