<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Regular drain inspections and cleansings are recommended every three years or so. Proper maintenance is key to extending the life of your pipe system. Relying on drain cleaners bought at the store can actually harm your pipes.

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
