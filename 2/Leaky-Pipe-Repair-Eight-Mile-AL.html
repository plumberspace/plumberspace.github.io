<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Eight Mile AL</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel method off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers manage all kinds of work. Their tasks break out into two classifications: Plumbers who handle standard repairs (often in emergency circumstances), and plumbers who specialize in remodeling tasks and additions.</p>
