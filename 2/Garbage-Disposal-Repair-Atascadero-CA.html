<p>The LAGBC is based upon the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, typically known as "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to obtain consistency among the various jurisdictions within the State; lower the building's energy and water use; lower waste; and reduce the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal debris can often get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>

We typically perform repairs on devices that are still under warranty, as this will be the most cost reliable alternative for you. Regardless of the repair or replacement needed, you can rely on us to do it properly-- every time. We take pride in supplying quality suggestions and on following through to make certain that every task is done properly. For quality that doesn't compromise, pick Red Cap.</p>
