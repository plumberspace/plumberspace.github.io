<p>Tough water use may affect the efficiency of household home appliances. When warmed, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A big scale buildup slows the heating procedure and needs more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large accumulations of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life span. Scale deposits also build up to plug plumbing fixtures and develop in other appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashers, thus affecting their performance.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
