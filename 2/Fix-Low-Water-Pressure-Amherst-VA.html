<p>Some pipe products are cheaper than others; some are more vulnerable and brittle to cracking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other materials are prone to corrosion and rust while some are unaffected. Certain pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat pressure, making them more vulnerable to structural tensions and strains as an outcome of temperature change and ice formation. And these distinctions determine the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to get in the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
