<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Havelock NC</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
