<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Elkin NC 28621</h3>
<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is merely recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (normally salt or often potassium).</p>
