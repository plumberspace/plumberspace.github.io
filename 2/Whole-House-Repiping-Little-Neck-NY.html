A home's service line (likewise referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the homeowner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Some states need steamfitters and pipefitters to be licensed; they might also need a special license to work on gas lines. Licensing normally requires an exam or work experience or both.

<p>These valves have a lot of flexibility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention choices, but they also offer the least amount of security.

This disc increases and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to permit air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
