It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
