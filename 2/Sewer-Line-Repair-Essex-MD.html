<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some homes were enabled to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the home.

If everything is ready, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time.
