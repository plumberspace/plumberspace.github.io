<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) once you've found the journey lever you desire eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank.

Keep in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the proper method. When you've protected the trip lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
