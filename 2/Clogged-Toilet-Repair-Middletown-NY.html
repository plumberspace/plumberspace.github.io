<h3>Shower Repairs in Middletown NY 10940 - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
