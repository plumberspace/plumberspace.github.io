A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.
