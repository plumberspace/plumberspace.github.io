<p>When a big enough source of water has been determined and evaluated, the third major part of a water system system enters play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its consumers. The biggest of these primary long-distance transmitting pipes are described as aqueducts. Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable covering, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. A lot of big cities need several aqueducts providing water from varied and geographically separated sources.</p>
