Continuous feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of garbage disposal, nevertheless, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal debris can often get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>
