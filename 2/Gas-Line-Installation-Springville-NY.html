<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably limit the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
