For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be installed and a feasible source of gas developed. Another function of an electrical water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated properly utilizing vents and ducts in order to work properly. With electrical designs, you will not need to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
