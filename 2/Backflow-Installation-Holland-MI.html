<p>In truth, reverse circulation testing developed to ensure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was removed from NFPA 25 in 2011.

<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular incident, however it does occur regularly than you think! When you don't discover the water was off for a few minutes, typically it occurs at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow.

Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
