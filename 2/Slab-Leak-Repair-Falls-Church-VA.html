This is a type of plastic resin that was widely utilized by home builders for homes built in the 1970s through the 1990s. The problem with this kind of plastic piping is it can end up being brittle and break quickly, specifically if your water is chlorinated or chemically dealt with.</p>
<p>Setting up a new gas line in the kitchen will typically range from $300 to $800 depending on the length of the pipe required.
