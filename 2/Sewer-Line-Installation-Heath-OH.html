<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Heath OH</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Another risk that can arise from the poor or improper installation of a gas line or appliance is an increase carbon monoxide levels in your home. Since it is unsavory and odor free although it is really dangerous, it is challenging to detect carbon monoxide. Since breathing in carbon monoxide gas results in poisoning and in some circumstances death, you should make sure that your plumbing is done professionally. Furthermore, you could install carbon monoxide gas detectors in your home.</p>
