I just recently had a number of plumbing leakages fixed and could not be happier with the prompt service I received from Parker and Sons. They are very knowledgeable, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would certainly recommend them to my household and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your house.</p>
<p>Physical Damage: Cracks and dents to the physical water heater or water tank require help from skilled water heater contractors. Most of the times, we replace the damaged part to prevent leaking or deterioration.
