<p>No other room in a house consists of as lots of pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. We now have actually cleaned up and examined the components parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their elements, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now ready to start the re-assembly procedure. Some designs require the components to be removed in a particular order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Lots of parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each part is put back into the body, it is necessary to put them back in the correct area. It is also essential that as they are put back into the body, that no foreign matter is connected on the components or mistakenly put in the body. The components need to be put so that the guides have the ability to preserve their developed tolerances.</p>
<p>Before selection and installation, describe makers literature for temperature level ranges. All assemblies should be secured from freezing temperature levels and if installed where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a warm water type assembly must be utilized. Consult manufacturers specifications for suggestions.
