<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>

Once it has actually passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve plan created to avoid the turnaround of the circulation of water.
