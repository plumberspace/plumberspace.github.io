Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, rusting the sidewalls and only partially fixing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively seek out organic material and gnaw at it, creating harmless by-products of carbon water, dioxide, and mineral ash, all of which are quickly dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
