<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and satisfy our stiff trust accreditation standards. An excellent general rule is to replace faucets that reveal deterioration, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and wore away parts make repairs tough and pricey, indicating a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the appropriate fix for concerns such as missing or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little parts of the whole fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>
<p>When the flush valve in the tank stops working or wears out, another irritating issue is. If you hear the toilet running constantly or periodically you probably need the valve or float changed.  Failing to repair a running toilet can result in lost water and a really high water costs. Water in Florida is costly so don't delay-- get a running toilet repaired.</p>
