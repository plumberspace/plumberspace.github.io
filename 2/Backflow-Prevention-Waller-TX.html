<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Waller TX 77484</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
