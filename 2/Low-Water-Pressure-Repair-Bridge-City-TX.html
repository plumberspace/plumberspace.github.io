<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Bridge City TX 77611</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
