<p>Discover the best water softener for you. One typical way for a home's water system to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines.

A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in individual residences, it also avoids wastewater in personal houses from receding out and infecting the general public water supply.</p>
