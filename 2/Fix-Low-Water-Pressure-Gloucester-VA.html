It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and combined with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
