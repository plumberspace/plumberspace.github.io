However, particular issues with your water heater may indicate that it's time for a replacement. Our Wheaton plumbers can help you figure out which course of action is best for you.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows happen from them, these water features are considered a health danger. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area should be shown on building strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a water fountain or garden pond need to be evaluated upon installation and after that yearly.</p>

<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts should be removed and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. It is important that just original factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to use and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
