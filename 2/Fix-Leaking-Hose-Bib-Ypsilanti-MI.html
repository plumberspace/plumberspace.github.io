<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Ypsilanti MI 48197</h3>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is simply catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>

<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
