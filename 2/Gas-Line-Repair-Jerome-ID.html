Plumber's putty can not be used on certain brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>

You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
