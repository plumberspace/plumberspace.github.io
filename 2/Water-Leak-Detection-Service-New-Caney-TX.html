<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that impact. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the large, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
