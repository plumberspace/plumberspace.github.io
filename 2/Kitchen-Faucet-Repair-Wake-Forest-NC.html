<p>Next, examine the body. Depending upon the size and maker, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again important for the repair professional to be familiar with the firmness of the products so that their cleaning process is not devastating. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to lessen any scale growth or corrosion.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
<p>There are more than 17,000 backflow prevention assemblies on water services in our service area.
