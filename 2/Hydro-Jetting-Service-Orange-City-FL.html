<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite direction from its normal circulation. IRWD's drinkable water system is designed to keep the water streaming to you.

This creates a backflow condition and the capacity for infected water getting in the safe and clean water circulation system.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons for drain line obstructions in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a failing garbage disposal, or too much food being gotten rid of down the drain. We will usually advise our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the seriousness of the circumstance.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many years, however steel eventually struggles with corrosion and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
