<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>You can utilize a wire coat hanger by correcting it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some obstructions.
