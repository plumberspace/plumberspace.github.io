<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Needham MA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Tree roots can be a major factor in affected sewer lines. Tree roots grow in various instructions and can get huge causing intrusion of the lines underground. Another reality is that tree roots try to find water sources and will follow the source leading them straight to sewer lines ultimately growing right into them and causing significant sewer line problems.</p>
