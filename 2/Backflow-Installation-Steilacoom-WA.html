<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Steilacoom WA 98388?</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Common enough that many people opt for diy repairs. But sometimes even determining the leak can be an issue. It might be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, waste disposal unit fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
