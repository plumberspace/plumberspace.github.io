<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it simply suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing regular and major leakages. If you do have frequent leaks, we find that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and better long-term option.</p>
