<p>Leakages - If your hot water heater is leaking, you may need to replace the system. With time leaks can trigger other problems and even trigger mold to grow around the unit. Get it fixed as soon as you can if you notice a leak. Linking irrigation to fountains, swimming pools and garden ponds restricted: State law and City ordinance hold that no irrigation system might be connected to a fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond. These water functions may just be filled with drinkable water. Water which has gotten in an irrigation system is not safe and clean.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows happen from them, these water features are considered a health danger. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be indicated on building plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond must be checked upon installation and after that every year.</p>
