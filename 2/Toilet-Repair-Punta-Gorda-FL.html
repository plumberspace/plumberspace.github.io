<p>Making sure plumbing devices such as lawn sprinkler and fire pumps are isolated to their own respective networks is essential in order to preserve potable water safety. Having a plumbing inspection is pretty basic when buying a house or flat. , if it's a leasing I have not seen a plumbing inspection done.. Again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In truth, if not done it can be one of the most expensive repair projects if ignored. For example, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is an issue, you may need all of your water piping changed. Again, very costly. This is just among numerous problems that can appear.</p>

Regs. § 19-13-38a( c)( I)).</p>
