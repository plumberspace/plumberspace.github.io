<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
