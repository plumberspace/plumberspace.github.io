<p>Replacing your flapper may need somewhat different actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but possibilities are you'll find among the very same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
