This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is simply catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
