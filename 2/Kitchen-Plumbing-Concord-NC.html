<p>Finally, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best utilized in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
<p>Galvanized piping is accountable for a minimum of half of the plumbing emergency situations that we run into in the houses around the Bay Area.
