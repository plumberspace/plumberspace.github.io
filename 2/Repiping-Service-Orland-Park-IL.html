The biggest of these primary long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Typically constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes designed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. A lot of big cities need several aqueducts supplying water from varied and geographically apart sources.</p>
