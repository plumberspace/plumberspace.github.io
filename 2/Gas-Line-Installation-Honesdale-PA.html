Your home's main seamless gutter system collects rainwater from the roofing line and controls its course down your home to ground; but the water might still puddle next to the foundation.

Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them resembles a procedure used to clear debris from the side rain gutter pipes on your house.</p>
<p>Distribution pipes transition to even smaller individual service pipes, carrying water to individual homes, home shops, companies and buildings.

Private service pipelines are typically made from plastic, lead or Type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be vital.</p>
