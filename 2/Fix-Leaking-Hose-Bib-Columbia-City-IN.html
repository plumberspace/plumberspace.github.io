<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Columbia City IN 46725</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are installed in large, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
