<p>Sewer lines have one vital function: carry wastewater out of a house or building. Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting just wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very pricey alternative.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by hooking up a hose to drain the tank to an ideal drain. Flushing the water heating tank should be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might provide a fast fix in the short-term, it can cause even more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. A good place to begin trying to find the leaking kitchen sink plumbing system is underneath the puddle of water or where you appear to feel the wetness most.</p>

I just recently needed to replace the water heater in my house and it was just 6 years old. Traditional hot water heater with a tank must typically last 10 to 15 years.
