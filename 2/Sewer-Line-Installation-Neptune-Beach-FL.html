When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If enabled to return to the supply of water, there is capacity for the infected water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
