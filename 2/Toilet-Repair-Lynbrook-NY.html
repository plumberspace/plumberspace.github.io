<p>Hot water heater can be a costly financial investment for homeowners that they live with for over a years. That's why when it's time to equip your brand-new home or replace your old water heater, it's important to consider the cost, efficiency, and longevity of a new system. Plumbers generally charge $45 to $65 an hour and can generally install a hot water heater in a day or in 6-8 hours.</p>

For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.
