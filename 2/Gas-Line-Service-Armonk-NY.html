<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No hot water in your house? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these concerns, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs and even a replacement.
