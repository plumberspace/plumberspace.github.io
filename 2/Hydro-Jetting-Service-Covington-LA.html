<p>A newly installed hot water heater should not produce strange sounds, but it will start to create rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder over time as the heater runs to heat the water. Things intensify dramatically for homes with a high need for hot water. The factors for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be essential.</p>

<p>Downsides to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
