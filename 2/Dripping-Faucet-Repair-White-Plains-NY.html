Unnoticeable or noticeable, these problems have real expenses associated with them. Clogged fixtures cause replacement or refurbishing expenses and can frustrate your consumers. Scale accumulation in your hot water heater will inflate your energy costs, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement expenses. Soon, these little costs can amount to make a real impact on your bottom line.</p>
