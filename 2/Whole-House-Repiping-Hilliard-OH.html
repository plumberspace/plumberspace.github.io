<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely vital part of the style of each element. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities.

For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
