<p>Leaks are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
