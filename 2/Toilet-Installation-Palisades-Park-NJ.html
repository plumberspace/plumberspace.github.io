<p>Plastic pipe remains in wide use for domestic supply of water and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types consist of: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to manufacture until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established a technique to plasticize PVC, making it much easier to process. PVC pipe began to be made in the 1940s and remained in large use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.
