<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a feasible solution, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and household.</p>
