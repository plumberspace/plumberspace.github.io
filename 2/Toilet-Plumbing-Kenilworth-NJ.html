<p>Water softeners include value to your operation by securing your water-using devices from bad performance and premature failure. Some tough water problems are extremely noticeable, like sprayers and dispensers ending up being clogged.

Noticeable or undetectable, these problems have actually real costs connected with them. Clogged fixtures cause replacement or reconditioning expenses and can irritate your customers. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy bills, and too soon damaged RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement expenses.
