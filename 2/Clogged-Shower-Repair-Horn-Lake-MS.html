Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
