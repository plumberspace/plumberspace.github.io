<p>Tough water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits build up, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes.

You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
