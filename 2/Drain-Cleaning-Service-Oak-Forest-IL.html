<p>It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately operating RPZ assembly to periodically release percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations based on water damage.

<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a practical option, particularly when easy plunging does not appear to work.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
