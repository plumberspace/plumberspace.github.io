An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc.

These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
