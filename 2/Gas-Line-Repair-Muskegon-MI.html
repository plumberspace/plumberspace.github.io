<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
